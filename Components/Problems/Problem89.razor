Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a \"best\" way of writing a particular number.</p>\n<p>For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:</p>\n<p class=\"margin_left monospace\">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br>\nVIIIIIIIIIII<br>\nVVIIIIII<br>\nXIIIIII<br>\nVVVI<br>\nXVI</p>\n<p>However, according to the rules only <span class=\"monospace\">XIIIIII</span> and <span class=\"monospace\">XVI</span> are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.</p>\n<p>The 11K text file, <a href=\"resources/documents/0089_roman.txt\">roman.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see <a href=\"about=roman_numerals\">About... Roman Numerals</a> for the definitive rules for this problem.</p>\n<p>Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.</p>\n<p class=\"smaller\">Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.</p>";
