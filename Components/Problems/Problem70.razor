    protected override string Description => "<p>Euler's totient function, $\\\\phi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$, and $8$, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, $\\\\phi(9)=6$.<br>The number $1$ is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\\\\phi(1)=1$. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, $\\\\phi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$ is a permutation of $79180$.</p>\n<p>Find the value of $n$, $1 \\\\lt n \\\\lt 10^7$, for which $\\\\phi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$ and the ratio $n/\\\\phi(n)$ produces a minimum.</p>";
