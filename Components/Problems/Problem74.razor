For example,</p>\n$$\\\\begin{align}\n&amp;69 \\\\to 363600 \\\\to 1454 \\\\to 169 \\\\to 363601 (\\\\to 1454)\\\n&amp;78 \\\\to 45360 \\\\to 871 \\\\to 45361 (\\\\to 871)\\\n&amp;540 \\\\to 145 (\\\\to 145)\n\\\\end{align}$$\n<p>Starting with $69$ produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>\n<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>";
