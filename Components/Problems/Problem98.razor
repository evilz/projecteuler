What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: $9216 = 96^2$. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"resources/documents/0098_words.txt\">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).</p>\n<p>What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?</p>\n<p class=\"smaller\">NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.</p>";
